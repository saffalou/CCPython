# Occasionally when working with strings, you’ll find that you want to include characters that already have a special meaning in python. For example let’s say I create the string
#  favorite_fruit_conversation = "He said, "blueberries are my favorite!""
# We’ll have accidentally ended the string before we wanted to by including the " character.
# The way we can do this is by introducing escape characters.
# By adding a backslash in front of the special character we want to escape, \", we can include it in a string.
# favorite_fruit_conversation = "He said, \"blueberries are my favorite!\""

# the following will throw a syntax error
# password = "theycallme"crazy"91"

#  to use that password we do the following
password_1 = "theycallme\"crazy\"91"


print(password_1)
